**Interactive Desktop Portfolio**

---

## About the Project  
**MiniDesk** is an interactive web portfolio presented as a virtual computer desktop.  
Users can interact with the desktop just like with a real system — clicking on icons, opening windows, moving them around, and exploring different sections such as **About**, **Projects**, **Links**, **Contact**, and more.

The goal of this project is to transform a traditional portfolio into a playful and creative experience, where your website feels like a functional little computer sitting on a desk.

## Features  
- **Interactive windows** — open, move, and close different app-like windows on the screen.  
-  **Light & Dark mode** — easily switch between two visual themes.  
-  **Sound effects** — toggle sound feedback on or off for actions like opening and closing windows.  
-  **Desktop simulation** — feels like using a real mini operating system.  
-  **Explore content** — read about the author, browse projects, follow links, and check contact info — all inside draggable desktop windows.
