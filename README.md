# 🖥️ MiniDesk  
**Interactive Desktop Portfolio**

---

## 💡 About the Project  
**MiniDesk** is an interactive web portfolio presented as a virtual computer desktop.  
Users can interact with the desktop just like with a real system — clicking on icons, opening windows, moving them around, and exploring different sections such as **About**, **Projects**, **Links**, **Contact**, and more.

The goal of this project is to transform a traditional portfolio into a playful and creative experience, where your website feels like a functional little computer sitting on a desk.
